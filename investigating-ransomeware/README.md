## Overview
Conducting investigations is a core component of cybersecurity. When we detect something, it's essential to figure out what happened by asking questions like: who, what, where, when, why, and how. Investigations can be either reactive or proactive, depending on the context.

## Components of Investigation
1. **Incident Response:**
   - Immediate actions taken to address and mitigate an ongoing security incident.
   - Includes containment, eradication, and recovery processes.
   
2. **Threat Hunting:**
   - Proactively searching for signs of malicious activity within an environment.
   - Aims to identify threats that may have evaded traditional security measures.
   
3. **Insider Threat Detection:**
   - Monitoring and detecting suspicious or malicious activities carried out by authorized users within the organization.
   - Helps prevent data breaches and insider attacks.
   
4. **Security Operations:**
   - The ongoing, day-to-day activities related to managing and maintaining security within an organization.
   - Involves monitoring, analyzing, and responding to security alerts and events.

## Scenario: Investigating Cerber Ransomware Attack at Wayne Enterprises

### Incident Overview:
- **Date and Time:** August 24, 2016
- **Affected Machine:** we8105desk
- **Type of Attack:** Ransomware (Cerber)
- **Impact:** Data encryption, potential data loss, disruption of operations

### 1. Identifying the IP Address of a Victim System

**Question:** What was the most likely IP address of we8105desk on August 24, 2016?

**Procedure:** Since we are given an identifier of the host and timestamp, we can use this to examine the logs.

- By searching `"index=botsv1 we8105desk"` and adjusting the specific timestamp to August 24, 2016, we can now access all the data sources related to the incident.
![image_1](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/c170cedc-84af-4f01-8a9a-583d1d906c7d)

- By clicking the host on the left side fields, we can see the top host.
![image2](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/f5c2408d-9366-474c-a429-a39f5cb70e59)

- By clicking the source on the left side fields, we can see the top source.
![image3](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/e1d0ebd5-9153-498a-be21-2a9becb1fd9f)

- There are a lot of commands to get the same results you want in Splunk. For this, I will use the `top` command to get the top 10 by default `src_ip` by searching the query below:

    ```spl
    index=botsv1 we8105desk sourcetype=XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | top src_ip
    ```
    ![image4](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/700b56a4-3fb4-41e5-951b-97bf7cff8af9)

### Threat Details:
- **Hostname:** we8105desk
- **IP Address:** 192.168.250.100

### 2. Identifying Removable Media

**Question:** What is the name of the USB key inserted by Bob Smith?

If we don’t know much about USB drives and Windows, the first thing you could do is Google for something like the search terms below and do some reading:

- finding the usb name in windows registry logs
- finding windows registry usb name site:microsoft.com

**Resources:**
- [USB Device Registry Entries]([usb_device_registry_entries_link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/?redirectedfrom=MSDN))
- [Splunk Answers - USB Detection]([splunk_answers_usb_detection_link](https://community.splunk.com/t5/Splunk-Search/Finding-USB-and-Removable-Media-Detection/td-p/273918))

**Sourcetypes:**
- Winregistry

By searching `“index=botsv1 sourcetype=winregistry friendlyname”`, we can use the “friendlyname” keyword given in the article.

![image5](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/045b15cd-0c3c-410f-b890-2332d1e9a66c)

- Expand the raw logs to see the full details of the logs as well as the different fields. By doing this you can look for fields that you can use to filter much more specific events related to this USB.

![image6](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/b85f85e7-8b0e-4573-84f7-ff89aae60316)

- Based on the search filter we have gathered, I built an optimized and specific search query to find the USB key name:

    ```
    (index=botsv1 sourcetype=winregistry object=friendlyname object_category=registry dest=we8105desk event_status="(0)The operation completed successfully.")
    | table user, object, dest, _time, data, status 
    | rename user as who, object as what, dest as where, _time as when, data as usb_key_name 
    | convert ctime(when)
    ```

![image7](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/de5ab933-c0da-4ab5-be13-b7e59c397774)

### Threat Details:
- **Hostname:** we8105desk
- **IP Address:** 192.168.250.100
- **USB Key Name:** MIRANDA_PRI

### 3. Identifying the Malicious File

**Question:** After the USB insertion, a file execution occurs that is the initial Cerber infection. This file execution creates two additional processes. What is the name of the file?

**Sourcetypes:**
- XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational

- Using the search query provided on the Splunk App, we can find the infected system on an external drive:

   ```
      index=botsv1 sourcetype=XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational host=we8105desk (CommandLine="*d:\\*" OR ParentCommandLine="*d:\\*") 
      | table _time CommandLine ParentCommandLine 
      | sort _time
   ```

![image8](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/3407bf4f-6fe5-4f2f-8664-55e25dc61777)

### Threat Details:
- **Hostname:** we8105desk
- **IP Address:** 192.168.250.100
- **USB Key Name:** MIRANDA_PRI
- **Malicious File:** Miranda_Tate_unveiled.dotm 

### 4. Identifying Suspicious Processes Executing

**Question:** During the initial Cerber infection, a VB script is run. The entire script from this execution, pre-pended by the name of the launching .exe, can be found in a field in Splunk. What is the length in characters of this field?

**Sourcetypes:**
- XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational

Using the initial search provided by the app, we can see all the executable files:
![image9](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/29e1219b-e76a-4549-a2d8-e281ee680ec8)

Expanding all the fields on the left side screen, we see the field name "CommandLine":
![image10](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/cbadabb2-25de-4162-8b1b-e15d36781f93)

Using the Text Function "len" to return the character length of a string, we can find the command with the top length:

![image10](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/9fc3cef3-3a4e-4fad-aef3-f75f979eca91)

### Threat Details:
- **Hostname:** we8105desk
- **IP Address:** 192.168.250.100
- **USB Key Name:** MIRANDA_PRI
- **Malicious File:** Miranda_Tate_unveiled.dotm

### 5. Identifying File Server Connections from Infected Host

**Question:** Bob Smith's workstation (`we8105desk`) was connected to a file server during the ransomware outbreak. What is the IP address of the file server?

**Sourcetypes:**
- XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, winregistry

Using our threat details search again for the host and finding the top destination IP address:

  ```
     index=botsv1 sourcetype=XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational host=we8105desk src=we8105desk.waynecorpinc.local 
     | top dest_ip
  ```
![image11](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/e03c9e6b-324d-4d3d-b65d-e8511ed7553c)

  - Using the keyword "fileshare" on winregistry, we can see all the file shares that happened on the host:
![image12](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/fe093dd5-1ad0-4a7f-bb8c-ac1164b971c5)

  - Expanding the raw logs to see the file path of the file share, we use the key_path field name to get the top file path:
![image13](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/854a9f67-76f6-4d13-8bee-64f420865dde)

  - To get the hostname of that IP Address on the file share, we filter the IP address and use the top command on the dest_host field name:

```
index=botsv1 sourcetype="XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" 192.168.250.20 
| top dest_host
```
![image14](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/b52821b4-13db-4b95-b35c-30dcf33a9c68)

### Threat Details:
- **Hostname:** we8105desk
- **IP Address:** 192.168.250.100
- **USB Key Name:** MIRANDA_PRI
- **Malicious File:** Miranda_Tate_unveiled.dotm 

## File Server
- **Hostname:** we9041srv
- **IP Address:** 192.168.250.20

### 6. Identifying the First Suspect Domain Visited by the Victim

**Question:** What was the first suspicious domain visited by we8105desk on August 24, 2016?

**Sourcetypes:**
- stream:dns

- To find the historical traffic from the IP address "192.168.250.100", I initiated the following search:
   ```
      index=botsv1 sourcetype=stream:DNS src=192.168.250.100
   ```
   ![image15](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/4346acee-fe95-4c8b-b7b6-bbe5fb59fb62)

- By using the app filter to exclude legitimate domains and specifying the source and destination IP addresses, it became easier to identify the traffic:
    ```
          index=botsv1 sourcetype=stream:DNS src=192.168.250.100 record_type=A NOT (query{}=*.microsoft.com OR query{}=*.waynecorpinc.local OR query{}=*.bing.com 
          OR query{}=isatap OR query{}=wpad OR query{}=*.windows.com OR query{}=*.msftncsi.com) 
          | table _time query{} src dest 
          | reverse 
    ```
   ![image16](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/638dea72-fea2-4d05-bc21-333f4d284b3d)

### 7. Identifying Cryptor Code Filename and Origin

**Question:** The malware downloads a file that contains the Cerber ransomware cryptor code. What is the name of that file?

**Sourcetypes:**
- stream:http, suricata, fgt_utm

- Starting with the source IP address "192.168.250.100" and the suspicious domain "solidaritedeproxomite.org", filter for stream logs:

```
   index=botsv1 sourcetype=stream:http src=192.168.250.100 url=*solidaritedeproximite.org*
   | table src dest_ip url _time
```

- Since we have seen a suspicious image on that domain, check the FortiGate firewall for the data it captured from "mhtr.jpg":
  
```
   index=botsv1 sourcetype=fgt_utm src=192.168.250.100 mhtr.jpg 
   | table _time src dest msg url action
```
![image18](https://github.com/michaelsayala/splunk-boss-soc/assets/110712766/731f5d46-0555-442d-b00d-4456c7457405)
