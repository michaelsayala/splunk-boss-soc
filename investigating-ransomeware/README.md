# Investigating Ransomware with Splunk

## Overview
Conducting investigations is a core component of cybersecurity. When we detect something, it's essential to figure out what happened by asking questions like: who, what, where, when, why, and how. Investigations can be either reactive or proactive, depending on the context.

## Components of Investigation
1. **Incident Response:**
   - Immediate actions taken to address and mitigate an ongoing security incident.
   - Includes containment, eradication, and recovery processes.
   
2. **Threat Hunting:**
   - Proactively searching for signs of malicious activity within an environment.
   - Aims to identify threats that may have evaded traditional security measures.
   
3. **Insider Threat Detection:**
   - Monitoring and detecting suspicious or malicious activities carried out by authorized users within the organization.
   - Helps prevent data breaches and insider attacks.
   
4. **Security Operations:**
   - The ongoing, day-to-day activities related to managing and maintaining security within an organization.
   - Involves monitoring, analyzing, and responding to security alerts and events.

## Data Types Utilized in the Workshop
1. **Microsoft Sysmon:**
   - A Windows system service that logs detailed information about process creations, network connections, and more.
   
2. **Windows Events:**
   - Log files generated by the Windows operating system, containing information about system events and activities.
   
3. **Windows Registry:**
   - A hierarchical database used by the Windows operating system to store configuration settings and options.
   
4. **IIS (Internet Information Services):**
   - A web server software package created by Microsoft.
   - Logs generated by IIS can provide insights into web server activity and potential security issues.
   
5. **Splunk Stream (wire data):**
   - A Splunk component used for capturing, indexing, and analyzing wire data (network traffic).
   - Helps in monitoring network activity and detecting suspicious patterns or anomalies.
   
6. **Suricata:**
   - An open-source intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS).
   - Provides real-time traffic analysis and alerts on suspicious network activities.
   
7. **Fortigate (NGFW - Next-Generation Firewall):**
   - A firewall appliance developed by Fortinet that incorporates features such as intrusion prevention, antivirus filtering, and application control.
   - Logs generated by Fortigate can provide insights into network traffic and security events.
